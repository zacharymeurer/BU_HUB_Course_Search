This course challenges the conventional notions of  \"politics,\" \"religion,\" and \"blackness,\" and instead encourages students to  critically engage with these concepts through a diverse range of multimedia  sources, including literature, film, performances, and modes of discourse. By  exploring the complexities, controversies, and nuances of the relationship  between religion and politics, this seminar invites students to grapple with the  indeterminate and contested nature of this connection in the modern world. By  examining historical and contemporary examples, students will gain insights into  the challenges, conflicts, and possibilities that arise from the interplay  between religion and politics within Black populations throughout the African  diaspora. This critical examination will shed light on how blackness disrupts  and reshapes traditional academic approaches, creating new avenues for  understanding and engaging with the complexities of religion and politics.

Through these musical practices, we  will investigate the ways in which many of these styles are the product of  long running intra/intercultural dialogues, struggles, and negotiation  processes that continue to produce new hybrid forms. Because of the vast  array of people and cultures within each selected area, this course is  necessarily selective and introductory. A variety of scholars and performing  artists will be invited to give a workshop on music/dance and discuss their  lives as musicians. Over the course of the semester, you will gain an  understanding of the myriad ways people use music to construct and  individual group identities, the diverse ways groups incorporate music into  their lives, and how to understand music within a broader historical,  political, and economic context. You will also be introduced to basic  musical concepts and terminology, and acquire listening skills that will  enable you to better encounter and understand music in this course and  beyond.

Delves into the  intricate and interconnected relationship between politics and religion within  the Black experience. This course challenges the conventional notions of  \"politics,\" \"religion,\" and \"blackness,\" and instead encourages students to  critically engage with these concepts through a diverse range of multimedia  sources, including literature, film, performances, and modes of discourse. By  exploring the complexities, controversies, and nuances of the relationship  between religion and politics, this seminar invites students to grapple with the  indeterminate and contested nature of this connection in the modern world. By  examining historical and contemporary examples, students will gain insights into  the challenges, conflicts, and possibilities that arise from the interplay  between religion and politics within Black populations throughout the African  diaspora. This critical examination will shed light on how blackness disrupts  and reshapes traditional academic approaches, creating new avenues for  understanding and engaging with the complexities of religion and politics.

       "149  This course offers both an introductory look at four selected  regions/countries among the diverse musical cultures around the world: West  Africa, Bulgaria, Brazil, and Korea. Through these musical practices, we  will investigate the ways in which many of these styles are the product of  long running intra/intercultural dialogues, struggles, and negotiation  processes that continue to produce new hybrid forms. Because of the vast  array of people and cultures within each selected area, this course is  necessarily selective and introductory. A variety of scholars and performing  artists will be invited to give a workshop on music/dance and discuss their  lives as musicians. Over the course of the semester, you will gain an  understanding of the myriad ways people use music to construct and  individual group identities, the diverse ways groups incorporate music into  their lives, and how to understand music within a broader historical,  political, and economic context. You will also be introduced to basic  musical concepts and terminology, and acquire listening skills that will  enable you to better encounter and understand music in this course and  beyond.

How Does Art Happen? Who Is Art For? How Do You Make Art  History? We will consider artists that challenged viewers' and philosophers'  ideas about what makes something a work of art. These experimental artworks  brought new people into the story of art history, expanding our understanding of  who can be an artist (all of us).

This course      explores the work of contemporary poets who directly engage the current     moment,  who show us that art can function as political action. Among the     controversial  topics that these authors draw attention to and comment on   are   racial  injustice, mass incarceration, war, LGBTQ rights, immigration   policy,   and  environmental devastation. Through our course texts and   students' own   poems, we  will consider the ethics of appropriation and   representation, as   well as the  use of personal experience and found   documents in poetry.

Many were characters as well--in their       own lifetime and after their deaths. In this course, we explore the       character of the writer as portrayed in multiple genres including fiction,       essay, biography, autobiography, obituaries, and docudramas.  We ask how       does our perception of an artist change over time? How might literary       biography serve as a lens to discuss changing conceptions of creativity,       trends in historiography, and the development of literary canons? Our four       case studies focus on Emily Dickinson, Louisa May Alcott, Toni Morrison,     and   Sylvia Plath.
