# BU_HUB_Course_Search
Algorithm that takes a list of BU Hub credits that need to be fulfilled and returns BU Courses that fulfill as many of the given Hub credits as possible

Offers course information (description, prerequisites, credits, Hubs, etc.) and registration information (open seats, meeting times, location, etc.) about any class.

*Note*: The current classes feature is deprecated. BU has changed their primary course registration website in Spring 2024. The old registration website which this function was dependent on is no longer updated by BU.
